# Security-Authentication
The objective is about performing distinguishing attack on a pair of popular random number generators with machine learning. The attack is posed as a two-class classification (supervised learning) problem. You are welcome to employ any sort of classification approach, be it classical machine learning, deep learning, or others.
A large set of random data is generated in the form of bitstreams. There are three columns in the dataset. The first column denotes the ID of the bitstream. The second column comprises the random bitstreams generated by applying different random number generators. Each bitstream has a length of 1024 bits. The third column consists of the labels (0 and 1), which denote the random number generator type.

The performance metric for the two-class classification on the test dataset will be the accuracy score. You need to submit a pdf containing your experimental results with your approach, precompute(if any), results and comparison analysis. You can upload codes in a public git repo and mention the link in your submission document. 
NOTE: This classification task is challenging and anything beyond 50% may be a non-trivial result.
